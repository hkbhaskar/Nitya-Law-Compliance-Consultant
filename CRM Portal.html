								<p>CRM means a combination of business strategies, software and processes that help build long-lasting relationships between companies and their customers
<br><br><br>
CRM stands for “Customer Relationship Management” and refers to all strategies, techniques, tools, and technologies used by enterprises for developing, retaining and acquiring customers.
<br><br><br>
This software ensures that every step of the interaction with consumers goes smoothly and efficiently in order to increase the overall profits. The software gathers customer data from multiple channels. Hence, CRM stores detailed information on overall purchase history, personal info, and even purchasing behavior patterns.

		<h2>WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM CRM?</h2><br>
<p>The best part about a CRM system is that almost any organizational unit can benefit from it — from sales and customer service to recruiting, marketing, and business development. Good CRM software gives a better way to manage external relationships.
<br><br>
Storing all customer information in one place, recording service issues, identifying sales opportunities, managing marketing campaigns — these are just a few capabilities that CRM features.
<br><br>
Since CRM provides easy access to data, it also becomes much easier for users to collaborate on different processes and increase productivity. Another strong argument in favor of CRM is that it is suitable for businesses of any size.
<br><br>
Maintaining good relationships with customers is the cornerstone of every successful business, but in decades past, the process of managing and tracking customer relationships within a business was fragmented and time-consuming at best. Companies would store physical customer data in filing cabinets, rolodexes, and spreadsheets.
<br><br>
These methods of customer-data storage not only involved a lot of manual work, but they also meant the information wasn’t properly distributed across the business (between sales and marketing departments, for example), often leading to missed business opportunities.
<br><br>
With the introduction of the Internet came a wave of new marketing-technology (MarTech) platforms to help companies create, manage, and track customer relationships in the form of a customer relationship manager (CRM).</p><br>
<h2>What Does a CRM Do?</h2><br>
<p>At the most basic level, CRM software allows marketers and salespeople to manage and analyze relationships with the company’s actual and potential customers. It enables tracking every interaction with the company and collects information about the customer.
<br><br>
This way, when speaking to a customer, the marketer always knows who they are and sees their history with the company. This makes the interaction more personalized, increases the chances of conversion, and encourages customer trust and loyalty.
<br><br>
CRMs include functionalities which allow you to track customer/company interactions through various available touchpoints, including those from:
<br>
- Contact forms<br>
- Search engines<br>
- Emails<br>
- Phone calls<br>
- Social media<br><br>
The software takes care of certain processes—it can offer automation of marketers’ repetitive tasks, sets reminders for important events, and displays alerts if things really need attention. Some CRMs also offer analytics capabilities, allowing you to track the efficiency of various marketing efforts to generate leads and conversions.
<br><br>
CRM software, in combination with marketing automation, provides sales and marketing teams with a set of tools to manage the entire sales and marketing funnels, from lead qualification to opportunity management, forecasting, and deal closure.</p>
  <br><h2>Here’s a list of functionalities typically offered by a CRM platform:</h2><br>
  <p>1. Lead management: A CRM tracks the company’s leads, allowing marketing teams to enter new leads into the system (automatically or manually) and to track and analyze data about them.
<br><br>
2. Marketing automation: Some CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce offer marketing-automation functionalities to automate certain tedious tasks in the funnel. For example, the system can automatically send customers marketing emails at times set by the marketer, or publish social media posts according to a schedule. The goal of marketing automation is to keep sales leads engaged and to help turn them into paying customers.
<br><br>
3. Sales automation: CRMs can track customer interactions and automate selected business functions of the sales cycle that are necessary to follow leads and attract and obtain new customers.
<br><br>
4. Workflow automation: CRM systems help businesses optimize processes by streamlining mundane workloads, which enables employees to focus on creative and more high-level tasks.
<br><br>
5. Analytics: CRM solutions can offer built-in analytics tools that offer insights and help boost customer satisfaction rates. A marketer can analyze the data and create targeted campaigns accordingly. CRM analytics help to track attribution and provide insights into the quality of the customer experience.
<br><br>
6. Artificial intelligence: CRM solutions like Salesforce offer AI capabilities built into their systems to help automatically recognize patterns leading to successful sales, which can help you build more accurate strategies for future marketing efforts.
<br><br>
7. Individualized customer experiences: You can also use a CRM to create personalized and consistent experiences for your potential customers across various marketing channels, which may help increase conversions and boost brand awareness.</p>
