                                <p>Duplicate Page Introducing Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been a big tax reform in India. And so much time has passed since its introduction that questions like “what is GST Registration” do not sound right. So here is a brief introduction.
<br><br>

- Goods and Services Tax Law in India is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based
tax that is levied on every value addition.<br><br>
- GST is a single domestic indirect tax law for the entire country. <br><br>
- If your business is not GST registered, heavy fines and penalties can be levied.<br><br>

															<h2>Key Point & Advantage</h2><br>

							<p><b>1. Right way of doing business:-</b> Goods and Services will be taxed with both CGST and
SGST. In case of interstate trade of goods and services, IGST will be levied. IGST will
be collected by Central and distributed with the State and this will lead to a seamless
national market with less compliance and transparency.
<br><br>
<b>2. Uniform procedure:-</b> The procedures for refund of taxes and registration of taxpayers will be common, while the formats of tax return will be uniform. The tax base will also be common, as will the system of assortment of products or services in addition to the timelines for each activity, thereby ensuring that taxation systems have greater certainty.
<br><br>
<b>3. Removing the cascading effect :-</b> An important benefit of the introduction of GST will be the removal of the cascading tax effect. In simple words, “cascading tax effect” means a tax on tax. Under the current regime, the service tax paid on input services cannot be set off against output VAT. Under GST, the input tax credit can be availed smoothly under the entire GST chain, thus reducing the tax burden on the end user and removing cascading effect.
<br><br>
4. Composition Scheme is a simple and easy scheme under GST for taxpayers. Small taxpayers can get the rid off from GST formalities and pay GST at a fixed rate of turnover. Commonly this scheme can be opted by any taxpayer whose turnover is less than Rs. 1.5 crore.</p>
<br><br><h2>Process For Gst Registration:-</h2><br>
<p>1. Access the GST portal and click on new registration option and enter the details as asked and carefully filling the form, enter the given captcha and click on the ‘proceed’ button.
<br><br>
2. Generate TRN by completing the OTP verification and complete the GST application
after putting TRN.
<br><br>
3. login using TRN and fill the application as per the requirement and upload the required documents like electricity bill of registered office address, Photo, Certificate of incorporation ( in case of company assessee) and other supported documents.
<br><br>
4. After uploading all documents, submit the application using DSC or EVC. And then ARN is generated.
<br><br>
5. After ARN, You can track the status on GST portal as well. Department have right to
approve the GST and share the Login credentials over the registered mail id. If there is some incompleteness found in application, query raise by GST officers and applicant
needs to submit the query within prescribed time.</p><br><br>
<h2>For Proprietorship</h2><br>
<p>When a business is owned and governed by one person, it is called a sole proprietorship company. This type of business can be incorporated in 6-7 days and hence makes it one of the most popular types of business to begin in the unsystematic sector, specifically among merchants and small traders. For a Sole Proprietorship business, registration is not required as it is identified through alternate registrations, such as GST registrations. However, its liability is unlimited and it also doesn’t have perpetual existence.
<br><br>
<b>1. Easy formation and management:-</b> The formation of sole proprietorship business is very easy and simple. No legal formalities are involved for setting up the business. The entrepreneur with initiative and certain amount of capital can set up such form of business. The cost of formation of a sole proprietorship is the minimum because no cost is involved in its formation excepting the license fee in certain cases if required.
<br><br>
<b>2. Single hand control:-</b> Each and every aspect of the business is looked after by the proprietor and the business secrets are up to to him only. He has no legal obligation to publish his accounts. Thus, the maintenance of adequate secrecy leaves no scope to his competitors to be aware of the business secrets.
<br><br>
<b>3. Free from sharing any particular to Government:-</b> Sole proprietorship is the least regulated type of entity. It is easy to form and easy to dissolve without intervention of the Government.
<br><br>
<b>4. Discretionary dissolution:-</b> Like that of formation, the dissolution of the sole
proprietorship is also very easy. Since the proprietor is the supreme authority and no
regulations are applicable for closure of the business, he can dissolve his business any
time whenever its seems that business is not working properly or any other reason.<br><br>
<h2>GST Process :-</h2><br>
<p>1. Provide the Pan Card if already have. Otherwise will apply fresh.<br><br>
2. Select unique name of the proprietorship business.<br><br>
3. Get your firm authorized with a chartered accountant.<br><br>
4. Apply for GST registration if business turnover exceeds Rs 20 lakh.<br><br>
5. One can also get a Udhyam Registration (Micro small medium enterprise registration (MSME)); though it’s not mandatory.<br><br>
6. Contact with bank for opening a current account with banks in the name of the
proprietorship firm.</p>
