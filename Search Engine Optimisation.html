                                <h2>Search Engine Optimisation</h2><br>
								<p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is often about making small modifications to parts of your website. When viewed individually, these changes might seem like incremental improvements, but when combined with other optimizations, they could have a noticeable impact on your site's user experience and performance in organic search results.
</p><br>
<h2>1. What is SEO & Why is it Important?	</h2><br>
<p>Search engine optimization is the process of optimizing web pages and their content to be easily discoverable by users searching for terms relevant to your website. The term SEO also describes the process of making web pages easier for search engine indexing software, known as "crawlers," to find, scan, and index your site.</p>

<h2>2. Why Should You Care About SEO?</h2><br>
<p>Billions of searches are conducted online every single day. This means an immense amount of specific, high-intent traffic.
<br><br>
Many people search for specific products and services with the intent to pay for these things. These searches are known to have commercial intent, meaning they are clearly indicating with their search that they want to buy something you offer.
<br><br>
People are searching for any manner of things directly related to your business. Beyond that, your prospects are also searching for all kinds of things that are only loosely related to your business. These represent even more opportunities to connect with those folks and help answer their questions, solve their problems, and become a trusted resource for them.
<br><br>
Are you more likely to get your widgets from a trusted resource who offered great information each of the last four times you turned to Google for help with a problem, or someone you’ve never heard of?</p><br>
<h2>3. SEO Keyword Research & Keyword Targeting Best Practices</h2><br>
<p>The first step in search engine optimization is to determine what you’re actually optimizing for. This means identifying terms people are searching for, also known as “keywords,” that you want your website to rank for in search engines like Google.
<br><br>
There are several key factors to take into account when determining the keywords you want to target on your site:
<br><br>
<b>Search Volume</b> – The first factor to consider is how many people are actually searching for a given keyword. The more people there are searching for a keyword, the bigger the potential audience you stand to reach. Conversely, if no one is searching for a keyword, there is no audience available to find your content through search.
<br><br>
<b>Relevance</b> – A term may be frequently searched for, but that does not necessarily mean that it is relevant to your prospects. Keyword relevance, or the connection between content on a site and the user's search query, is a crucial ranking signal.
<br><br>
<b>Competition</b> – Keywords with higher search volume can drive significant amounts of traffic, but competition for premium positioning in the search engine results pages can be intense.</p>
<br><h2>4. On-Page Optimization for SEO</h2><br>
<p>Once you have your keyword list, the next step is actually implementing your targeted keywords into your site’s content. Each page on your site should be targeting a core term, as well as a “basket” of related terms.</p><br>
<h2>These fifteen points to elevate the understanding and position of SEO in the marketing mix for SEO .</h2><br>
<p><b>1. Channel Share:</b> Fifty-three percent of traffic to websites comes from organic search (source: BrightEdge Organic Channel report). Organic search delivers the most traffic to websites by a wide margin.
<br><br>
<b>2. Search Share:</b> On average, 83 percent of the traffic from search engines comes from SEO, and 17 percent from paid search (source: BrightEdge internal data).
<br><br>
<b>3. Share of Focus:</b> Even though organic search accounts for the majority of traffic, most companies spend more money on paid search. Paid search owned 15% of web search in 2019.
<br><br>
<b>4. Long-Term Traffic Equity:</b> While SEO does require an upfront resource investment, search engine rankings, once earned, have long-term duration.
<br><br>
<b>5. Organic Traffic:</b>  SEO traffic has no media cost and can provide a substantial ROI – higher than most other channels. Search engines appreciate and reward content that is relevant to readers and written for them rather than for bots. Focus on optimizing for your target audience.
<br><br>
<b>6. Structure:</b>  Proper SEO helps organize your website and makes it easier for your visitors to navigate and transact.
<br><br>
<b>7. Alignment:</b> Marketing works best when all channels are aligned on the same message – including organic search. Multiple channel alignment improves results in all channels.
<br><br>
<b>8. Brand Elevation:</b> SEO success secures a share of voice on the search engine results pages, and this is an integral component of your brand and creating brand trust.
<br><br>
<b>9. Conversion:</b> SEO traffic often converts better than other channels due to the fact that rankings often convey trust from the search engines. While paid search produces results quickly, it lacks authenticity and therefore should be paired with SEO strategies, too.
<br><br>
<b>10. Channel Synergy:</b> Your other marketing channels generate demand for people to query the search engine for products and services such as yours. If your website is not there to collect the demand you spent money creating, your competitors will collect it.
<br><br>
<b>11. Market Consideration:</b> Organic search is a critical part of the research process, especially for products or services with a long sales cycle. People use search engines to create a list of candidates for the product or service and use them again to collect opinions and reviews that help them make decisions.
<br><br>
<b>12. Search and Social:</b> SEO works in tandem with social media; some queries are more sensitive to “fresh results,” and social signals, which can impact and determine positioning in the search results. Social media helps shape your brand’s presence online and drive traffic back to your site.
<br><br>
<b>13. Research:</b> SEO research allows you to understand user interest and intent and build content that addresses and captures that intent.
<br><br>
<b>14. Content Distribution:</b> Focusing on SEO and legitimate link building leads you to develop relevant, useful content that people want to share and provides digital word of mouth.
<br><br>
<b>15. Global Reach:</b> SEO has global reach and can even provide dynamic translation and localization that can bring in new and unexpected customers from all corners of the world.</p>
