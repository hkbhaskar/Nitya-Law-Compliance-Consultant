                                <p>A Private Company is a legal entity enjoying a separate personality which requires controlling its active status through the regular filing with MCA. For every business, it is compulsory to file an annual return and audited financial reports with MCA for every fiscal year. The RoC filing is necessary irrespective of the turnover, whether it is zero or in crore. Whether a single business is undertaken or none, annual compliances for private limited are compulsory for every certified company.<br><br>
Both the forms are applied to report the activities and financial date for concerned Financial Year. The due terms for annual filing of a company are based on the time of the Annual General Meeting. The perpetual failure may lead to the elimination of the company’s name from RoC’s register, including incompetence of directors. Also, it has been noticed that MCA has actively taken bold measures for dealing with any such failures. The compliances relevant to the company could be segregated into two sections Mandatory Compliances and Event-Based Compliance</p>
